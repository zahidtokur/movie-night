# movie-night
A random movie recommendation program within your filters(minimum IMDb rating, release year, genre).

## I pre-scraped all the data from IMDb and saved it to movieDb.db. If you don't care about little updates just run movieNight.py

If you want to update the database, use scrape.py. Before updating, you need to check if there is currently a higher rated movie in a  certain category than "MAX_RATING" value and update it accordingly. Then, check if there is more movies in a certain category than before. For example, if there is 340 movies under Animation category by the time you are using this, add 301 to the "ALL_INDICES" list inside the "Animasyon" dictionary. That's because each page contains a maximum of 50 titles. After you checked these for each category you are good to go.
